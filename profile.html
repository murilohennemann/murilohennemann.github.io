<h1>Who am I?</h1>
                       
                        <p>I am a young graduate student with a background undergraduate focused in multimedia design while my masters is focused in my interest with story telling, science fiction and technology. As someone that believe design and technology are not separated, instead two sides of the same coin, it is a given that they are intertwined in all projects I do.<br><br>
As someone which lived in 3 different countries I could experience different kinds of jobs and cultures. From volunteer jobs while studying on a USA High School to a internship on Hyundai Advanced Design team. From those experiences I achieved some prizes, student leader while in USA (2009), excellence and merit scholarship from Korean Foundation for Promotion of Private School (KFPP - 2013) and the most recent one the participation with an article published for the 2017 Gwangju Bienalle.<br><br>
If I lack in Korean language, I definitely make it up in motivation and dedication. I am willing to cross the world to achieve my goals. Not only willing, but doing so everyday living in Korea. Studying design. And now, asking for an opportunity to join and become a better designer, but more important, a better human being.
